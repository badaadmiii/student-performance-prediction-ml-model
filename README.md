# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project predicts a student’s final exam score using academic data.


## Motivation
I am a Physics educator transitioning into AI, and this project reflects
how ML can be applied to real classroom scenarios.

# The Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Attendance percentage
- Weekly study hours
- Assignment scores
- Midterm exam score
- Previous exam score

Target:
- Final exam score

# Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

# Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score


# Future Work
- Classification version (pass/fail)
